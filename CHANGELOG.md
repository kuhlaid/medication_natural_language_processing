## [v0.1.0] - 2023.03.17

- [x] Documented how to create a SLURM job to execute the medication NLP (although it is debatable whether this code is NLP since there does not seem to be any learning involved)
- [x] Replacing data column index references with column names since it gives us better assurances we are using the intended columns
- [x] Using the latest versions of Python modules available (at least in my research computer environment) and adding a requirements.txt document outlining the Python module versions being used with the code
